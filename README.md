# hello-world
my first repository

I'm learning Management Information Systems (as well as Applied Math and Philosophy minors) in college currently, and teaching myself how to code. Right now, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python are languages I am trying to learn. I'd also like to learn Java, R, SQL, and Go.
